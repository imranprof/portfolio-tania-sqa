# Public Assets

Place your profile image here as `profile.jpg` or `profile.png`.

The image should be:
- Square aspect ratio (recommended: 512x512px or larger)
- Good quality and professional
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP

The Hero component will automatically use `/profile.jpg` - you can update the path in `app/components/Hero.js` if you use a different filename or format.
